gohack - a Rogue-like game written in Go

This is just for fun. So far, you can launch it, it generates a random
level, and you can walk around. That's it. There's some infrastructure
for monsters/species/etc, but nothing really happens yet.

I don't really think the world needs another Rogue-like... but then,
I've never written one. :-)
